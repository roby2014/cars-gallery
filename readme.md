# CarsGallery
## CarsGallery is a social media for cars photos/videos sharing.
This was my final high school IT course project (2021). 
I think it was a great experience because I learnt many things about web development, especially VueJS and ExpressJS.

### Tech used:
   - MEVN Stack - MySQL + ExpressJs + VueJS + NodeJS
   - [Frontend](https://github.com/roby2014/cars-gallery/tree/master/frontend): VueJS + Vuetify
   - [Backend](https://github.com/roby2014/cars-gallery/tree/master/backend): NodeJS + ExpressJS (Typescript!)
   - [Database](https://github.com/roby2014/cars-gallery/tree/master/backend/prisma/schema.prisma): MySQL + Prisma (ORM)

I want to thank deepz, Diogo Cardoso and ExpG for the help they gave me throughout the project development.
