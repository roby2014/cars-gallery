# CarsGallery
## CarsGallery is a social media for cars photos/videos sharing.
This was my final high school IT course project (2021). 

### Grade
**19/20** ☹️

### Note
This was my first touch with Vue and Express (and also web development in general), so don't expect **perfect** code.

### Tech used:
   - MEVN Stack - MySQL + ExpressJs + VueJS + NodeJS
   - [Frontend](https://github.com/roby2014/cars-gallery/tree/master/frontend): VueJS + Vuetify
